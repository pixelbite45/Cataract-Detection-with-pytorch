# Cataract-Detection-with-pytorch
A Flask web app that uses a CNN deep learning model to detect cataracts from eye images. Users can upload an image and get real-time predictions with confidence scores. Built with PyTorch for modeling and Bootstrap for a modern, responsive interface, making cataract detection simple and accessible.

This project is a deep learning-powered Flask web application that detects **cataracts** from eye images using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**. Users can upload an eye image and receive real-time predictions with confidence scores.
